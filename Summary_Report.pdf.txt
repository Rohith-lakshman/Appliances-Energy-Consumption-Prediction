Summary Report



Overview of Steps Taken

Explored the Data

Reviewed the dataset and selected 21 important features.

Features include temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

Prepared the Data

Converted data into sequences of 10 time steps for LSTM input.

Scaled the data using StandardScaler and saved the scaler.

Built the LSTM Model

Developed a 2-layer LSTM model using PyTorch.

Trained the model to predict energy usage and saved it.

Created an API with FastAPI

Developed a /predict endpoint to send input and get predictions.

Input requires 210 values (10 time steps Ã— 21 features).

Made a Dashboard with Streamlit

Built an interactive dashboard to input data and see results.

Visualized predictions and actual energy usage.






Challenges Faced

Creating time-step sequences was complex.

Avoiding overfitting and ensuring model accuracy.

Making sure input data was consistently scaled.

Linking the Streamlit UI with the API backend.

Handling long input data correctly in the API.




My Contributions

Performed data cleaning and feature selection.

Built and trained the LSTM model.

Developed the FastAPI backend.

Designed the Streamlit dashboard.

Ensured code is modular and well-documented.

Created README and usage instructions.
